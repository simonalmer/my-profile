				<h1> Bonjour I'm Simon Almér </h1>
				<img src="images/profile_picture.png" alt="Simon Almér" width="300px" class="img-circle">
				<p>Welcome to my page! I'm so happy you stopped by to visit. I'm a 23 year old student from the south of Sweden on an exchange to ESSEC in Cergy, and so far it's been a great adventure! Check out my passions and make sure to connect with me!</p>

				<h2>Web development</h2>
					<p>Designing and building websites for various ideas has always been something I've found very satisfying and entertaining. I've actually built a few wordpress websites before, such as a page for journalism or my own gardening firm. However, I relied on ready-made themes and plugins such as Elementor for drag-and-drop building which can be limiting and places constraints on your ideas. Also, with no knowledge it took many weeks to make... Therefore, I find it so interesting and helpful to finally learn HTML and CSS! I look forward to be able to build my own ideas from scratch, and to look over source code and know what to alter.

				<h2>Gardening & plants</h2>
					<p> My grandparents have a lovely classical Swedish farmers house outside of the city, and it was here where my passion for gardening was born. By helping out at a young age, I found how calming it was to take care of nature. It's also rewarding and gives me a great relief from thinking too much in academic studies ;) I decided to turn this passion into a business so I'm very happy! The first mission when entering my 12 square meter Chambre de bonne in Montmatre was of course to buy some plants at IKEA!</p>

				<h2>Coffee</h2>
					<p> If there's something that will always cheer me up it's a great cup of coffee. I grind my own beans and my favorite is a classic scandinavian drip coffe, similar to "americano". I've worked as a barista at local coffee shops in Sweden and my dream is to have my very own espresso machine at home. I recommend trying turkish coffee with cardamom prepared in a traditional way of heating it with warm sand. Check it out! </p>
